# Machine-Learning-Course-Project
This repo contains the final version of my Machine Learning Course Project, for peer review on Coursera


# Notes
I am unceratin why the figures will not render inside the .md file. The paths to the directories which contain the figures, uploaded to the repo on GitHug, are accurate.
(Please see the figures in the directories if you would like to view them. The code chunks are accurate for generating the plots.)
